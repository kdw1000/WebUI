![Menü: Status](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-status.png) 

Overview page with the current system status and the addresses of all IP interfaces plus additional information about DNS servers and the default gateway.

## 2.1 System > System identification 

![Menü: System > System identification](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_1.png) 

This web page of the SSV/WebUI summarizes various properties for gateway identification.

**Host name:** Input of an arbitrary name to be able to identify a certain gateway reliably.

**Location:** Enter the location information or details to find the installation location of a specific gateway.

**Contact:** E-mail address input to be able to reach the responsible person in charge of the gateway.

**Serial number:** Preset serial number of the gateway. This number can be used to answer queries about the production week, factory settings, delivery, etc. with the help of the manufacturer database.

**Identify device through front LED:** Pressing the flash button causes one of the gateway's front panel LEDs to flash for approx. 5 seconds. This allows a specific gateway to be visually identified.

## 2.2 System > System management 

![Menü: System > System management](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_2.png) 

The functions summarized here can be used to force a system restart (reboot) and to duplicate the configuration settings or reset them to the factory default state.

**Reboot system:** The gateway's operating system is shut down. This is followed by a reboot. The WebUI session must then be restarted. This action may cause the loss of unsaved settings.

**Configuration download:** The configuration set on this gateway via Web/UI can be downloaded as a file to the PC and saved using this function.

**Configuration upload:** A configuration settings file saved on the PC can be uploaded to the gateway to apply the settings from the file. ***Caution: This action will cause your gateway settings to be lost. They will be overwritten by the uploaded file. This may lock you out of the SSV/WebUI for further access.***

**Configuration reset:** Allows you to reset the settings you made via SSV/WebUI to the factory default state. For details on the factory default IP address, etc., refer to the *Remote Maintenance Gateway RMG/938 - First Steps* manual (https://ssv-comm.de/forum/dokumente/RMG938_FS_A.pdf).

## 2.3 System > Firmware update 

![Menü: System > Firmware update](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_3.png) 

**Firmware info:** This area shows you the current firmware version and a hash value for integrity checks on the installed firmware image. 

**Firmware update configuration:** Your gateway supports various remote update options. This involves downloading and installing individual software components or even a completely new firmware image from a trusted server. Software updates are a critical matter. In case of doubt, contact our support before performing an update.

## 2.4 System > App management 

![Menü: System > App management](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_4.png) 

The functions of the gateway can be extended via special apps. Most apps are available fo free. Some apps require a paid license, which you can purchase through your sales contact.

**Install app:** This function provides you with an up-to-date overview of the apps available for this gateway plus the respective version numbers. The overview is generated by an online access to an external server. This function therefore requires an Internet connection of the gateway. You can install the desired app via the button on the right edge of the respective line.

**Installed apps:** Here, the respective installed apps are displayed together with the respective version information. The information button can be used to display further information on the regarding app. You can also delete apps that have already been installed at any time using the button with the trash can icon.

## 2.5 System > Time and date 

![Menü: System > Time and date](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_5.png) 

**Local time zone configuration:** The time zone in which the gateway is operated is selected here. The setting is required in order to carry out the necessary correction during a time synchronization with time servers on the Internet (correction with respect to Greenwich Mean Time, i.e. the mean solar time at the Greenwich prime meridian). 

**Time and date configuration:** At this point you can select whether the internal gateway real-time clock is synchronized periodically via an external time server in a local network or on the Internet or whether a (one-time) manual time synchronization is to be performed via the SSV/WebUI connection.  

## 2.6 System > COM ports 

![Menü: System > COM ports](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_6.png) 

The serial interfaces of the gateway can be used universally for different applications. Via this web page of the SSV/WebUI, you can reserve individual interfaces for operation as a serial console (remote console) or as a "Com port redirector". By such a reservation the respective interface is no longer available for other applications.

Please note: The COM1 port of this gateway is located inside the housing. It is not accessible from the outside. This interface is fixed as a serial console for service purposes. Any other use is not possible. There are three options for the other interfaces:

**None:** The serial interface can be used by any application, e.g. by Node-RED for Modbus-based communication with external modules. 

**Remote console:** The respective serial port forms a console for communication with the Linux operating system. Please note that a login with user name and password is required for the use.

**Com port redirector:** This function forms a protocol converter between the IP-based transport protocols UDP or TCP, which are available e.g. for the LAN interfaces, and the respective assigned serial port. The UPD or TCP side can optionally be operated in client or server mode. 

## 2.7 System > Watchdog 

![Menü: System > Watchdog](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_7.png)

Your gateway has various watchdog timers or watchdog counters that are intended to ensure the most trouble-free 24/7 operation possible. Individual configuration setting options are available for these watchdogs.

**Enable watchdog service:** Enable or disable watchdog services of the gateway.

**Enable default watchdog:** Activate the individual watchdogs listed here with the factory default settings.

**Reboot interval:** Set a time interval after which a gateway reboot is automatically triggered. The gateway reboot sets all system processes to a (defined) initial state.  

A typical use case for this gateway is operation as a VPN client in a remote maintenance application. For this, depending on the configuration, it is important that a permanent VPN connection to an external VPN server exists. If this VPN connection is interrupted by any malfunctions, the gateway must automatically try to reach the server again. The following two setting options can be used to generate a gateway reboot if no VPN server connection is established within a certain time or if no VPN connection exists for a certain time.

**VPN1: Start delay:** Monitoring whether a VPN connection is established within a certain time. The gateway can automatically contact a VPN server after each boot process in order to integrate itself as a client in a VPN. If this integration does not work within the time specified here, a gateway reboot is generated.

**VPN1: Offline delay:** Monitoring how long no VPN connection to an external server has existed. If a VPN connection to the server has been interrupted and no new connection has been established, a reboot is generated after the time preset here has elapsed.

In many use cases, a gateway simultaneously maintains local connections to other systems as well as various external connections to the Internet (so-called WAN connections = Wide Area Network connections), e.g., to a time server and other special cloud and IoT service platforms. WAN connections are much more vulnerable to interference than a local connection. The following three setting options can be used to configure data volume-based WAN condition monitoring to trigger an automatic restart of the WAN interface hardware In case of malfunction (for example, a reset for the internal cellular modem).

**WAN: Traffic threshold:** Number of bytes per minute that must at least be transferred from the WAN in the direction of the gateway if a functioning WAN connection exists. This threshold determines whether the WAN connection is classified as OK or critical (undetermined). (Attention: This function is only useful for gateways with an internal cellular modem)

**WAN: Start delay:** Time period within which the number of bytes per minute specified by the threshold value (see Traffic threshold) must be reached after a gateway boot process. Otherwise a WAN interface hardware restart is generated after the time preset here has elapsed. (Attention: This function is only useful for gateways with an internal mobile modem)

**WAN: Idle delay:** Maximum time that may elapse without reaching the number of bytes per minute specified by the threshold (see Traffic threshold). Otherwise a WAN interface hardware restart is generated after the time preset here has elapsed. (Attention: This function is only useful for gateways with an internal mobile modem)

**Mobile: reset count:** This function is only for gateways with an internal cellular modem.

**Mobile: reboot count:** This function is only intended for gateways with an internal cellular modem.

## 2.8 System > Logging 

![Menü: System > Logging](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-system_8.png)

The gateway generates a logging file with extensive entries at runtime. It is used for diagnostics and for finding the cause of striking system behavior and other events. The logging file is regenerated with every gateway boot process and is lost when the supply voltage is switched off.

**Download log file:** This function allows you to download the logging file to your PC and save it there.

**Download service startup graph:** Using this feature you can download a graph with an overview of the startup of individual system services to the PC and save it there. 

## 3.1 Network > WAN 

![Menü: Network > WAN](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-network_1.png)

In many use cases, a gateway simultaneously maintains local connections to other systems as well as various external connections to the Internet (so-called WAN connections = Wide Area Network connections), e.g., to a time server and other special cloud and IoT service platforms. WAN connections are much more susceptible to disturbances than local connections. The following setting option can be used to configure ping-based WAN status monitoring (ping watchdog) in order to select a different physical gateway interface as the WAN interface in the event of a disturbance (WAN fallback interface, for example LAN2 instead of LAN1).

**WAN configuration:** Selection of a gateway interface for the WAN connection (only IP-capable interfaces can be selected, e.g. LAN1).

**WAN watchdog:** Here the ping watchdog for the WAN interface can be activated. To activate it, a ping test interval time must be selected (e.g. one ping test every 15 minutes). Furthermore, the DNS name or the IP address of the system that is to be reached via the WAN interface by ping test must be selected. In addition, the action to be performed in the event of an error in the ping test can be defined (see *WAN fallback interface*).

## 3.2 Network > LAN1 

![Menü: Network > LAN1](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-network_2.png)

**Interface configuration for LAN1:** Enable or disable the LAN1 interface.

**IPv4 address configuration:** This group contains the IPv4 address setting options for the LAN1 interface. You can choose between automatic IP address assignment via DHCP or manual address entry. Please note that more than one IP address can be assigned to the LAN1 interface. 

**IPv6 address configuration:** IPv6 address setting options for the LAN1 interface are summarized here. Analogous to IPv4 address assignment, automatic address assignment via DHCP or manual address entry of IPv6 addresses is possible.

**Expert configurations:** Various "expert settings" are available under this generic term. Changes should only be made by appropriately trained specialist personnel. Enable UPnP discovery (UPnP = Universal Plug and Play) is a special case. If this function is enabled, you can search for the gateway in a local network with a UPnP-capable device without knowing the IP address of the LAN1 interface. 

## 3.3 Network > LAN2 

![Menü: Network > LAN2](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-network_3.png)

**Interface configuration for LAN2:** Enable or disable the LAN2 interface.

**IPv4 address configuration:** This group contains the IPv4 address setting options for the LAN2 interface. You can choose between automatic IP address assignment via DHCP or manual address entry. Please note that more than one IP address can be assigned to the LAN2 interface.  

**IPv6 address configuration:** IPv6 address setting options for the LAN2 interface are summarized here. Analogous to IPv4 address assignment, automatic address assignment via DHCP or manual address entry of IPv6 addresses is possible.

**Expert configurations:** Various "expert settings" are available under this generic heading. Changes should only be made by appropriately trained specialists. 

## 3.4 Network > Bluetooth 

![Menü: Network > Bluetooth](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-network_4.png)

**General configuration:** The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface of the gateway can be switched on and off.

## 3.5 Network > Firewall and NAT 

![Menü: Network > Firewall and NAT](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-network_5.png)

Your gateway has a complex firewall system that can be used to monitor and filter the data traffic of all existing IP interfaces. The setting options are very extensive. If you want to use the firewall, an appropriately trained expert is definitely required for the settings. You can alternatively contact our support at any time.

Please note that the gateway firewall supports both IPv4 and IPv6. However, both IP protocol variants require their own rules in each case.

**Firewall configuration:** In this section you can display the current firewall rules and enable/disable and view a log file for firewall diagnostic tasks. 

**Firewall and NAT rules preconfigured sets:** The gateway has some predefined firewall rules, e.g. for applications in a remote access VPN. These preconfigured sets can be activated here or adapted to your own requirements. Furthermore, under these setting options it is also possible to upload a file with complete firewall and NAT rules from the computer to the gateway (upload of a *firewall and NAT rules script*).

**Forwarding with IP-Masquerading and NAT:** Under this entry, NAT-based routing between the gateway and the WAN (Wide Area Network) can be switched on and off. 

## 4.1 Services > General 

![Menü: Services > General](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_1.png)

Your gateway has both a Telnet and FTP server for compatibility with older SSV products. Both protocols are now considered insecure because they are based on unencrypted data transmission. In this respect, these protocols should be switched off for practical use of the gateway.

**General service configuration:** Here you can enable or disable access to the gateway via Telnet or FTP. Furthermore, the Shellinabox service can be enabled or disabled. Shellinabox (Shell-in-a-box) is a web page that can be accessed via a web browser, in which you can communicate with the gateway via a Linux console.    

## 4.2 Services > OpenVPN 

![Menü: Services > OpenVPN](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_2a.png)
![Menü: Services > OpenVPN](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_2b.png)

A typical application example for industrial gateways is their use in virtual private networks (VPNs) to implement remote maintenance applications. Here, the gateway forms a VPN client endpoint and enables a service engineer to securely remotely access the assemblies located behind the gateway (e.g., controllers in a local OT LAN). In such an application, all VPN clients connect to a central VPN server. Your gateway can simultaneously maintain connections to a maximum of three external VPN servers (see tabs *Client 1*, *Client 2* and *Client 3)*. Each connection can be configured individually with different certificates. In addition, the gateway can also be used as a VPN server (see *Server* tab).

**OpenVPN client configuration:** For each client connection to an external OpenVPN server, different protocol parameters can be set here in addition to the OpenVPN server IP address or the OpenVPN server DNS name. These configurations have to be done by an appropriately trained expert. Alternatively, you can also contact our support. 

**OpenVPN certificates and keys:** In this area, the certificate and key management for a VPN client connection takes place in order to be able to connect to the respective OpenVPN server.

## 4.3 Services > DynDNS 

![Menü: Services > DynDNS](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_3.png)

Your gateway enables applications in which it must itself be accessible via a DNS name on the Internet. One example would be operation as a VPN server. As such a gateway usually does not receive a static IP address on the Internet, DynDNS can be used as an alternative.

DynDNS or DDNS are abbreviations for dynamic DNS. This is a technique for dynamically updating the IP addresses of individual services in the Domain Name System (DNS). The purpose is that a computer system with a globally accessible service automatically and quickly changes the corresponding entry in the DNS after changing its IP address.

**DynDNS configuration:** Switching the DynDNS service update on and off. Selection of the DynDNS provider with which a corresponding account exists and the complete host name (FQDN = Fully-Qualified Domain Name). Furthermore, the update period can be set.

**Change DynDNS username and password:** Under this heading a new password for a user name can be set.

**Notification to webserver after IP address changes:** Enable and disable a notification service in case the IP address of the gateway has changed on the Internet.

## 4.4 Services > DHCP Server 

![Menü: Services > DHCP Server](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_4.png)

The gateway supports automatic IP address assignment via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to OT modules (DHCP client modules) that are connected to a gateway LAN interface. In other words, the gateway can be used as a DHCP server.

**General configuration:** Switching DHCP server operation on and off.

**Address range:** Specify the IP address range from which IP addresses are assigned to the client modules via DHCP. 

## 4.5 Services > SNMP 

![Menü: Services > SNMP](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_5.png)

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol developed by the IETF to monitor gateways and other network modules from a central management system and to change certain parameters. The protocol manages the communication between the monitored modules and the management system.

**SNMP configuration:** Switching SNMP operation on and off. Selection of the SNMP version and other parameters.

## 4.6 Services > Remote Access 

![Menü: Services > Remote Access](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_6.png)

**OpenSSH configuration:** SSH-based administrator access to the gateway is supported (SSH Secure Shell). An OpenSSH daemon (SSHD) runs within the gateway operating system for this purpose. The SSHD can be enabled, disabled and configured here. Furthermore, the current RSA key fingerprint is displayed.  

**Change passwort for user "root":** SSH access to the gateway is always performed with administrator rights (user "root"). The password for this user can be changed here. 

## 4.7 Services > WebUI 

![Menü: Services > WebUI](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-services_7.png)

The SSV/WebUI of your gateway supports two different user classes: 1) an administrator (*admin*) with all rights and 2) a user (*user*) with restricted rights, who is also only presented with an adjustable selective view of the SSV/WebUI.

**SSV/WebUI configuration:** In this area the whole WebUI can be switched off. Furthermore, various configuration settings are possible; e.g. the choice between the unprotected HTTP or the secure HTTPS protocol, the selection of the TCP port for HTTP or HTTPS access as well as the appearance of the SSV/WebUI.    

**Change admin access account:** Change the username and password for WebUI access with administrator rights (*admin*)

**Change user access account:** Set or change the user name and password for WebUI access with restricted user rights (*user*).

## 5.1 Proxies > Web 

![Menü: Proxies > Web](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-proxies_1.png)

If HTTP servers exist in the automation modules of an OT network, the web proxy function of your gateway can be used to increase IT security for access to these servers. For this purpose, a web proxy is configured for each HTTP server, which converts the insecure HTTP protocol into the secure HTTPS protocol. This creates an HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy. Subsequently, browser access by an external user no longer takes place directly to the HTTP server in the automation module, but via HTTPS to the proxy in the gateway.

**General configuration:** The web proxy function of your gateway can be switched on and off here.

**Proxy redirection:** In this area, the individual web proxy connections are displayed as an overview. Each individual proxy connection can be edited and deleted.

**Create / edit a redirection entry:** Under this heading a new web proxy connection is created. This requires the following entries: 1.) The TCP port number for the *Listen on port*. 2.) The IP address and the port number for the *Relay to* part. Furthermore, for an HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy, the *Encryption* (i.e. the SSL or TLS function) must be explicitly enabled. Otherwise, the result is an HTTP-to-HTTP proxy (i.e., a port redirection for external web access).

**SSL certificate:** A certificate is required for the HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy. This certificate can be created here.

## 5.2 Proxies > DNS 

![Menü: Proxies > DNS](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-proxies_2.png)

A DNS proxy routes DNS requests (DNS request) and DNS responses (DNS response) between DNS clients and a DNS server. The DNS proxy simplifies network management. For example, if the DNS server address changes, only a change in configuration is required for the DNS proxy, not for each individual DNS client.

**General configuration:** Here you can switch the DNS proxy service on and off.

## 5.3 Proxies > FTP 

![Menü: Proxies > FTP](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-proxies_3.png)

If FTP servers exist in the automation systems of an OT network, the FTP proxy function of your gateway can be used to redirect access to these servers to other TCP ports.

**General configuration:** The FTP proxy function of your gateway can be switched on and off here.

**Proxy redirection:** In this area, the individual FTP proxy connections are displayed as an overview. Each individual proxy connection can be edited and deleted.

**Create / edit a redirection entry:** Under this heading, a new FTP proxy connection is created. This requires the following entries: 1.) The TCP port number for the *Listen on* port. 2.) The IP address and the port number for the *Relay to* part

## 5.4 Proxies > TCP 

![Menü: Proxies > TCP](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-proxies_4.png)

A TCP proxy creates a TCP socket under a specified TCP port number (*Listen on port* socket) and creates a bidirectional data connection between this socket and another adjustable TCP socket (*Relay to* socket), which can be located on the same gateway or an external computer system with a static IP address.

**General configuration:** The TCP proxy function of your gateway can be switched on and off here.

**Proxy redirection:** In this area, the individual TCP proxy socket connections are displayed as an overview. Each individual socket connection can be edited and deleted.

**Create / edit a redirection entry:** : Under this heading, a new TCP proxy socket connection is created. This requires the following entries: 1.) The TCP port number for the *Listen on port*. 2.) The IP address and port number for the *Relay to* part.

## 5.5 Proxies > UDP 

![Menü: Proxies > UDP](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-proxies_5.png)

A UDP proxy creates a UDP socket under a specified UPD port number (Listen on port socket) and creates a bidirectional data connection between this socket and another adjustable UDP socket (Relay to socket), which can be located on the same gateway or an external computer system with a static IP address.

**General configuration:** The UPD proxy function of your gateway can be switched on and off here.

**Proxy redirection:** In this area, the individual UDP proxy socket connections are displayed as an overview. Each individual socket connection can be edited and deleted.

**Create / edit a redirection entry:** Under this heading, a new UDP proxy socket connection is created. This requires the following entries: 1.) The UDP port number for the *Listen on port*. 2.) The IP address and the port number for the *Relay to* part.

## 6.1 Apps > Node-RED 

![Menü: Apps > Node-RED](https://ssv-comm.de/forum/bilder/938-apps_1.png)

Some subsequently installable gateway apps create their own entries in the menu bar function *Apps* in order to provide the user with a configuration web page. The figure shown here illustrates the configuration page of the Node-RED app as an example.
 
**General configuration:** Node-RED can be switched on and off. If Node-RED is switched on, the software runs permanently as a process in the Linux operating system of the gateway and is also started automatically during every boot process. All flows generated under Node-RED are automatically brought to execution. Furthermore, the flows generated on one gateway under Node-RED can be exported here to a file on the PC and imported again on another gateway. In addition, a manual *Cleanup* can be generated for the memory area with the Node-RED flows (deletion of all flow components).

**Access protection:** Node-RED has a web-based interface that requires another browser window. Access to the Node-RED interface can be protected via a user login with username/password. The username and password can be set here. Furthermore, the web browser can access the Node-RED interface either via an unsecured HTTP or a protected HTTPS connection. This property can also be set here.
